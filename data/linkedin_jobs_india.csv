This program is a 6-month full-time paid placement aimed towards grads who have completed a BEng (or higher) in Computer Science / Electrical Engineering or Computer Technology (or similar degree). This program is also suited for engineers with 1-2 years experience but want to explore a new industry. The program will kick off early October in-person at our Bangalore office, requiring the ability to work full-time, on a permanent basis Who we are: Morse Micro is Australia’s largest semiconductor company building Wi-Fi HaLow (802.11ah) chips for the Internet of Things (IoT).

Feedback from our recent Graduate Engineers: “I discovered the Morse Micro Graduate Program through a friend and I am incredibly happy that I did! Morse Micro truly has such a positive culture and I have felt so valued and supported in my work. Unlike some other programs, you are offered the opportunity to get your hands on experience, start a project from scratch and develop skills which you wouldn’t ordinarily come across. Through rotations across each team, I have learnt and been aware of the complexity of the work across all the teams helping to understand the whole insight of the system. After the rotation period, we get to choose the team that aligns with our skills and interests. The program motivates and structures a graduate really well to succeed in their career. Morse Micro has its own tech talks given by highly experienced professionals and being able to access the knowledge is a huge bonus of joining the program. Additionally, having access to a mentor during each rotation made the transition easy and to grow relationships with colleagues and develop goals for the career. I realized each and even small details learnt during university is important in practical terms, and I would advise others to pay attention to each detail. The one thing I have learnt from the grad program is, to ask as many questions to mentors and seniors, even the question you think it will sound basic, still ask. This helps to enhance learning, build relationships and improve problem solving skills. I would highly recommend this program to other graduates.” Yamin Aye , February 2023 Graduate Program ‘’In university, one of my capstone ideas was to design a drone that can be controlled remotely via the internet (that idea was quickly turned down due to DJI and LoRa not capable of transmitting high bandwidth). During my studies, I heard about Morse Micro is the 1st company in Australia to develop a Wifi Halow chip that can transmit wifi ranging from 1-3km. So after graduating, when I knew that Morse Micro had a graduate program, I immediately applied as soon as possible. Had it not been for the graduate program, I don’t think I would have been able to work with so many talented people and have so many opportunities to challenge myself. I was a shy kid back in university but I quickly learned that in the real world if you want to know something, you have to ask. I remembered that I was struggling with one of the grad projects and had it not been for the help and encouragement of fellow Morse’s engineer, I wouldn’t have been able to figure out a solution. Advice I would give to the future graduates is to always have an open mindset and always challenge themselves to grow out of their comfort zone to progress their engineer journey.’’ Harry Nguyen, February 2022 Graduate Program ‘’ The grad program at Morse Micro is a fantastic way to dive into the Wi-Fi and semiconductor worlds. You’ll get the chance to learn from engineers across a wide breadth of fields about some very cool tech. I really enjoyed that one week I was able to see the real-life application of something I had learnt at uni, and the next week I was learning about something I had never heard of before. Hearing from each team and learning about what they do is a great way to find your footing and appreciate the technology as a whole. I really valued the community that the grads share and the social part of the work. Being able to share learning about interesting tech and research makes the work so rewarding. If that is something you are looking for, then I can absolutely recommend the grad program. ‘’ Lewis O'Flynn , September 2024 Graduate Program Check out what it is like to work at Morse Micro:",problem solving;testing

But we’re not just a fintech company. We’re a storytelling engine for India’s builder culture. From Razorpay (the brand) to Razorbae (our internet alter ego), we make startup life, money talk, and founder chaos actually fun to follow. We’ve built India’s most founder-loved brand — and now, we want someone who can make it even louder online. We’re looking for an Associate, Social Media Marketing professional who’s built different — someone who scrolls till 3 AM, saves trends before they trend, and can smell a viral moment before it drops. You’ll help run Razorpay and Razorbae’s entire social world — mixing founder culture, fintech smarts, and pure internet energy. Think of it as being part editor, part trend hunter, part chaos-architect. If you’ve ever thought “I could’ve done that post better,” this is your shot to prove it. What You’ll Actually Do Run Razorpay + Razorbae on Insta, LinkedIn, X, and YouTube Shorts — daily. Find trends before the trend accounts do. Re-spin them for startups, founders, and the Razorpay universe. Write captions that sound like a person, not a press release. Drop memes, reels, and threads that get people talking. Be in brainstorms, and maybe on camera when the vibe’s right. Team up with editors and designers to turn ideas into scroll-stoppers. Use AI tools to draft, caption, remix, and move fast. Track what hits, tweak what doesn’t, and keep experimenting. Basically: keep Razorpay in people’s feeds and heads. Who You Probably Are 1–2 years into the game (college, freelance, meme page, side hustle — all good). You’ve made stuff — posts, reels, memes, edits — that actually worked. You live online: Reels, Shorts, Threads, Substack, maybe even Reddit. You get why something blows up, not just how. You write like a human and think like a creator. You’re comfortable being on-camera and unfiltered. You’re allergic to “corporate social media.” Bonus Points If You’ve grown a page, brand, or creator account. You’ve gone viral (or know exactly how you would). You know your way around CapCut, Canva, ChatGPT, Runway, OpusClip. You think “content calendar” is just a fancy word for “moment radar.” Why You’ll Love It You’ll be part of a small, dangerous team that runs one of India’s boldest brands. No approvals that kill ideas. No endless decks. Just ideas → edits → posts → feedback → do it again, better. If you’re hungry, restless, and obsessed with how the internet moves — come build the next wave of brand storytelling with us. Location : Bangalore (On-site, 5 days a week)",

copywriter,CRED,"Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",https://in.linkedin.com/jobs/view/copywriter-at-cred-4336414091?position=1&pageNum=0&refId=XhsmUUU99aT1Pp73L9u5iA%3D%3D&trackingId=wH9k7MAxJmG96gzghdoakg%3D%3D,"what is CRED? CRED is an exclusive community for India’s most trustworthy and creditworthy individuals, where the members are rewarded for good financial behavior. CRED was born out of a need to bring back the focus on a long lost virtue, one of trust, the idea being to create a community centered around this virtue. a community that constantly strives to become more virtuous in this regard till they finally scale their behavior to create a utopia where being trustworthy is the norm and not the exception. to build a community like this requires a community of its own; a community special in its own way, working towards making this vision come true. here’s a thought experiment: what do you get when you put a group of incredibly passionate and driven people and entrust them with the complete freedom to chase down their goals in a completely uninhibited manner? answer: you get something close to what we have at CRED; CRED just has it better. visibility is easy. memorability is earned. at CRED, we build the latter. where words aren’t just written, they’re engineered to stay. they make people feel something. they make them think twice before settling for less. they shape decisions, sharpen products, and signal intent. we’re looking for someone who can lead that craft with clarity, taste, and conviction. what will you do: own CRED’s voice across the ecosystem: product, marketing, campaigns, comms. you’ll raise the standard, protect it, and evolve it actively shape the organisation’s understanding of language: how it drives perception, behaviour, and trust drive narratives for major launches: across app, films, brand campaigns, activations, and content platforms. the idea starts with you; the execution carries your fingerprints lead cross-functional storytelling: ensuring product, design, marketing, and PR speak with one voice and one level of intelligence architect communication frameworks for new products, verticals, and experiences. defend quality, articulate rationale, and negotiate for the time and space great work needs set up a culture of writing that’s bold, elegant, intelligent, and unmistakably CRED: across everything from a push notification to a brand film bring clarity in ambiguity: simplify the complex, challenge the obvious, and articulate intent without losing nuance you should apply if you: are someone who understands tone, semiotics, audience engineering, and the psychology behind how language moves people a thinker who knows the difference between humor and wit, and between confidence and noise a leader who can critique, elevate, and build someone who brings a point of view someone who can provide decisive feedback you’ve led creative or copy teams before, and elevated their quality through structure you can switch between executive conversations and craft conversations with ease you read widely, think deeply, and have a point of view on what excellent writing looks like in products, brands, and platforms how is life at CRED? working at CRED would instantly make you realize one thing: you are working with the best talent around you. not just in the role you occupy, but everywhere you go. talk to someone around you; most likely you will be talking to a singer, standup comic, artist, writer, an athlete, maybe a magician. at CRED people always have talent up their sleeves. with the right company, even conversations can be rejuvenating. at CRED, we guarantee a good company. hard truths: pushing oneself comes with the role. and we realise pushing oneself is hard work. which is why CRED is in the continuous process of building an environment that helps the team rejuvenate oneself: included but not limited to a stacked, in-house pantry, with lunch and dinner provided for all the team members, paid sick leaves and a comprehensive health insurance. to make things smoother and to make sure you spend time and energy only on the most important things, CRED strives to make every process transparent: there are no work timings because we do not believe in archaic methods of calculating productivity, your work should speak for you. there are no job designations because you will be expected to hold down roles that cannot be described in one word. since trust is a major virtue in the community we have built, we make it a point to highlight it in the community behind CRED: all our team members get their salaries before their joining date. a show of trust that speaks volumes because of the skin in the game. there are many more such eccentricities that make CRED what it is but that’s for one to discover. if you feel at home reading this, get in touch. We may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses. These tools assist our recruitment team but do not replace human judgment. Final hiring decisions are ultimately made by humans.

CRED is an exclusive community for India’s most trustworthy and creditworthy individuals, where the members are rewarded for good financial behavior. CRED was born out of a need to bring back the focus on a long lost virtue, one of trust, the idea being to create a community centered around this virtue. a community that constantly strives to become more virtuous in this regard till they finally scale their behavior to create a utopia where being trustworthy is the norm and not the exception. to build a community like this requires a community of its own; a community special in its own way, working towards making this vision come true. here’s a thought experiment: what do you get when you put a group of incredibly passionate and driven people and entrust them with the complete freedom to chase down their goals in a completely uninhibited manner? answer: you get something close to what we have at CRED; CRED just has it better. visibility is easy. memorability is earned. at CRED, we build the latter. where words aren’t just written, they’re engineered to stay. they make people feel something. they make them think twice before settling for less. they shape decisions, sharpen products, and signal intent. we’re looking for someone who can lead that craft with clarity, taste, and conviction. what will you do: own CRED’s voice across the ecosystem: product, marketing, campaigns, comms. you’ll raise the standard, protect it, and evolve it actively shape the organisation’s understanding of language: how it drives perception, behaviour, and trust drive narratives for major launches: across app, films, brand campaigns, activations, and content platforms. the idea starts with you; the execution carries your fingerprints lead cross-functional storytelling: ensuring product, design, marketing, and PR speak with one voice and one level of intelligence architect communication frameworks for new products, verticals, and experiences. defend quality, articulate rationale, and negotiate for the time and space great work needs set up a culture of writing that’s bold, elegant, intelligent, and unmistakably CRED: across everything from a push notification to a brand film bring clarity in ambiguity: simplify the complex, challenge the obvious, and articulate intent without losing nuance you should apply if you: are someone who understands tone, semiotics, audience engineering, and the psychology behind how language moves people a thinker who knows the difference between humor and wit, and between confidence and noise a leader who can critique, elevate, and build someone who brings a point of view someone who can provide decisive feedback you’ve led creative or copy teams before, and elevated their quality through structure you can switch between executive conversations and craft conversations with ease you read widely, think deeply, and have a point of view on what excellent writing looks like in products, brands, and platforms how is life at CRED? working at CRED would instantly make you realize one thing: you are working with the best talent around you. not just in the role you occupy, but everywhere you go. talk to someone around you; most likely you will be talking to a singer, standup comic, artist, writer, an athlete, maybe a magician. at CRED people always have talent up their sleeves. with the right company, even conversations can be rejuvenating. at CRED, we guarantee a good company. hard truths: pushing oneself comes with the role. and we realise pushing oneself is hard work. which is why CRED is in the continuous process of building an environment that helps the team rejuvenate oneself: included but not limited to a stacked, in-house pantry, with lunch and dinner provided for all the team members, paid sick leaves and a comprehensive health insurance. to make things smoother and to make sure you spend time and energy only on the most important things, CRED strives to make every process transparent: there are no work timings because we do not believe in archaic methods of calculating productivity, your work should speak for you. there are no job designations because you will be expected to hold down roles that cannot be described in one word. since trust is a major virtue in the community we have built, we make it a point to highlight it in the community behind CRED: all our team members get their salaries before their joining date. a show of trust that speaks volumes because of the skin in the game. there are many more such eccentricities that make CRED what it is but that’s for one to discover. if you feel at home reading this, get in touch. We may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses. These tools assist our recruitment team but do not replace human judgment. Final hiring decisions are ultimately made by humans.

copywriter,CRED,"Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",https://in.linkedin.com/jobs/view/copywriter-at-cred-4336414091?position=2&pageNum=0&refId=8JA3qUEWfQTRm1a5V99Huw%3D%3D&trackingId=icJVzWjlctGFwlVtdubaoQ%3D%3D,"what is CRED? CRED is an exclusive community for India’s most trustworthy and creditworthy individuals, where the members are rewarded for good financial behavior. CRED was born out of a need to bring back the focus on a long lost virtue, one of trust, the idea being to create a community centered around this virtue. a community that constantly strives to become more virtuous in this regard till they finally scale their behavior to create a utopia where being trustworthy is the norm and not the exception. to build a community like this requires a community of its own; a community special in its own way, working towards making this vision come true. here’s a thought experiment: what do you get when you put a group of incredibly passionate and driven people and entrust them with the complete freedom to chase down their goals in a completely uninhibited manner? answer: you get something close to what we have at CRED; CRED just has it better. visibility is easy. memorability is earned. at CRED, we build the latter. where words aren’t just written, they’re engineered to stay. they make people feel something. they make them think twice before settling for less. they shape decisions, sharpen products, and signal intent. we’re looking for someone who can lead that craft with clarity, taste, and conviction. what will you do: own CRED’s voice across the ecosystem: product, marketing, campaigns, comms. you’ll raise the standard, protect it, and evolve it actively shape the organisation’s understanding of language: how it drives perception, behaviour, and trust drive narratives for major launches: across app, films, brand campaigns, activations, and content platforms. the idea starts with you; the execution carries your fingerprints lead cross-functional storytelling: ensuring product, design, marketing, and PR speak with one voice and one level of intelligence architect communication frameworks for new products, verticals, and experiences. defend quality, articulate rationale, and negotiate for the time and space great work needs set up a culture of writing that’s bold, elegant, intelligent, and unmistakably CRED: across everything from a push notification to a brand film bring clarity in ambiguity: simplify the complex, challenge the obvious, and articulate intent without losing nuance you should apply if you: are someone who understands tone, semiotics, audience engineering, and the psychology behind how language moves people a thinker who knows the difference between humor and wit, and between confidence and noise a leader who can critique, elevate, and build someone who brings a point of view someone who can provide decisive feedback you’ve led creative or copy teams before, and elevated their quality through structure you can switch between executive conversations and craft conversations with ease you read widely, think deeply, and have a point of view on what excellent writing looks like in products, brands, and platforms how is life at CRED? working at CRED would instantly make you realize one thing: you are working with the best talent around you. not just in the role you occupy, but everywhere you go. talk to someone around you; most likely you will be talking to a singer, standup comic, artist, writer, an athlete, maybe a magician. at CRED people always have talent up their sleeves. with the right company, even conversations can be rejuvenating. at CRED, we guarantee a good company. hard truths: pushing oneself comes with the role. and we realise pushing oneself is hard work. which is why CRED is in the continuous process of building an environment that helps the team rejuvenate oneself: included but not limited to a stacked, in-house pantry, with lunch and dinner provided for all the team members, paid sick leaves and a comprehensive health insurance. to make things smoother and to make sure you spend time and energy only on the most important things, CRED strives to make every process transparent: there are no work timings because we do not believe in archaic methods of calculating productivity, your work should speak for you. there are no job designations because you will be expected to hold down roles that cannot be described in one word. since trust is a major virtue in the community we have built, we make it a point to highlight it in the community behind CRED: all our team members get their salaries before their joining date. a show of trust that speaks volumes because of the skin in the game. there are many more such eccentricities that make CRED what it is but that’s for one to discover. if you feel at home reading this, get in touch. We may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses. These tools assist our recruitment team but do not replace human judgment. Final hiring decisions are ultimately made by humans.

But we’re not just a fintech company. We’re a storytelling engine for India’s builder culture. From Razorpay (the brand) to Razorbae (our internet alter ego), we make startup life, money talk, and founder chaos actually fun to follow. We’ve built India’s most founder-loved brand — and now, we want someone who can make it even louder online. We’re looking for an Associate, Social Media Marketing professional who’s built different — someone who scrolls till 3 AM, saves trends before they trend, and can smell a viral moment before it drops. You’ll help run Razorpay and Razorbae’s entire social world — mixing founder culture, fintech smarts, and pure internet energy. Think of it as being part editor, part trend hunter, part chaos-architect. If you’ve ever thought “I could’ve done that post better,” this is your shot to prove it. What You’ll Actually Do Run Razorpay + Razorbae on Insta, LinkedIn, X, and YouTube Shorts — daily. Find trends before the trend accounts do. Re-spin them for startups, founders, and the Razorpay universe. Write captions that sound like a person, not a press release. Drop memes, reels, and threads that get people talking. Be in brainstorms, and maybe on camera when the vibe’s right. Team up with editors and designers to turn ideas into scroll-stoppers. Use AI tools to draft, caption, remix, and move fast. Track what hits, tweak what doesn’t, and keep experimenting. Basically: keep Razorpay in people’s feeds and heads. Who You Probably Are 1–2 years into the game (college, freelance, meme page, side hustle — all good). You’ve made stuff — posts, reels, memes, edits — that actually worked. You live online: Reels, Shorts, Threads, Substack, maybe even Reddit. You get why something blows up, not just how. You write like a human and think like a creator. You’re comfortable being on-camera and unfiltered. You’re allergic to “corporate social media.” Bonus Points If You’ve grown a page, brand, or creator account. You’ve gone viral (or know exactly how you would). You know your way around CapCut, Canva, ChatGPT, Runway, OpusClip. You think “content calendar” is just a fancy word for “moment radar.” Why You’ll Love It You’ll be part of a small, dangerous team that runs one of India’s boldest brands. No approvals that kill ideas. No endless decks. Just ideas → edits → posts → feedback → do it again, better. If you’re hungry, restless, and obsessed with how the internet moves — come build the next wave of brand storytelling with us. Location : Bangalore (On-site, 5 days a week)",
